                    <l part="F">The truth.</l>
                    <l>Estrella, ponder well; what brought the King</l>
                    <l>Into this house, alone, at such an hour,</l>
                    <l>Unless it were Estrella? The little slave,</l>
                    <l>Matilde, was with him; for by the fall</l>
                    <l>Of footsteps I inferred it, and, lynx-eyed,</l>
                    <l>My honour did divine her in the dark.</l>
                    <l>I drew my sword, and 'Who goes there?' I cried.</l>
                    <l>A voice replied 'A man'. I closed with him,</l>
                    <l>And he, avoiding me, Estrella, said</l>
                    <l>He was the King; and though I saw 'twas true,</l>
                    <l>I feigned I knew him not, for it pleased heaven</l>
                    <l>To grant me patience. He, stung to the quick,</l>
                    <l>A king indeed, attacked me boldly, for</l>
                    <l>A king who draws his sword in anger takes</l>
                    <l>His courage in both hands. The pages then</l>
                    <l>Came in with lights, and, fearing to be seen,</l>
                    <l>He turned and fled, unknown of all but me.</l>
                    <l>I taxed the slave-girl; she, without the need</l>
                    <l>Of torture, yielded up the truth. The King</l>
                    <l>Had made her promise of full liberty</l>
                    <l>In a signed paper she had there –the proof</l>
                    <l>Whereby I did denounce her treacherous guilt.</l>
                    <l>I dragged her forth, lest her corruptive breath</l>
                    <l>Should spread dishonour through these noble halls.</l>
                    <l>Without the door, I seized her in my arms,</l>
                    <l>Flung her across my shoulder, and went thus</l>
                    <l>Straight to the royal palace, on whose walls</l>
                    <l>I hanged her for the offence. The King shall know</l>
                    <l>For every Tarquin there's a Brutus here,</l>
                    <l>And Seville's sons are honourable men.</l>
